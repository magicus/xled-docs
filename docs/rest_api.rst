RESTful API reference
=====================

Overview
--------

Twinkly rest API is primary way to get information about the device, configure network and modes of the device. It is a HTTP 1.1 based API sent over TCP port 80.

This API is used by mobile applications. It haven't been made public yet so it may change at any time.


Request Authentication
``````````````````````

Most API requests require valid authentication token. Except of:

* login
* gestalt
* fw version

If API requires authentication but valid token wasn't passed server returns HTTP status code 401 Unauthenticated and string `Invalid Token.` in the response body.


HTTP Responses
``````````````

The HTTP response can be used to determine if the request was successful, and if not, whether the request should be retried.

200 Success
	The request was successful.

401 Unauthenticated
	Request requires authentication but authorization failed. Application didn't handle the request.

404 Not Found
	If a string `Resource not found.` is found in the response body check if API endpoint is implemented in the current firmware version.


Application hierarchy
`````````````````````

Endpoints seem to be organized into hierarchy by applications. Overview of the hierarchy:

* `login`
* `verify`
* `logout`
* `gestalt`
* `device_name`
* `timer`
* `led`

  * `mode`
  * `effects`

    * `current`

  * `config`
  * `movie`

    * `full`
    * `config`

  * `out`

    * `brightness`

  * `driver_params`
  * `reset`

* `fw`

  * `version`
  * `update`
  * `0`

    * `update`

  * `1`

    * `update`

* `network`

  * `scan`
  * `scan_results`
  * `status`

* `mqtt`

  * `config`

Application responses
`````````````````````

The API may return application status as `code` value of JSON. Returned will not necessarily "correspond" with the HTTP status code. For example, a HTTP status code 200 OK returned with an error application code indicates that the request successfully reached the server, but application cannot process the request.

1000
	Ok

1101
	Invalid argument value

1102
	Error

1103
	Error - value too long? Or missing required object key?

1104
	Error - malformed JSON on input?

1105
	Invalid argument key

1107
	Ok?

1108
	Ok?

1205
	Error with firmware upgrade - SHA1SUM does not match

Set LED movie config
--------------------

Since firmware version 1.99.18.

HTTP request
````````````

`POST /xled/v1/led/movie/config`

Parameters
``````````

Parameters as JSON object.

`frame_delay`
	(integer) the delay in milliseconds between two consecutive frames. For *n* fps, this is *1000 / n*.

`leds_number`
	(integer) seems to be total number of LEDs to use

Response
````````

The response will be an object.

`code`
	(integer), application return code.

Get current brightness
----------------------

Gets the current brightness level.

Since firmware version: 2.3.5.

HTTP request
````````````

`GET /xled/v1/led/out/brightness`

Response
````````

The response will be an object.

`code`
	(integer), application return code.
`mode`
	(string) one of "enabled" or "disabled".
`value`
	(integer) brightness level in range of 0..255

Mode string displays if the dimming is applied. The led shines at full
brightness regardless of what value is set if the `mode` is `disabled`.
Brightness level value seems to represent percent so 0 is dark and maximum
meaningful value is 100. Greater values doesn't seem to have any effect.


Example
```````

Request::

	GET /xled/v1/led/out/brightness HTTP/1.1
	Host: 192.168.4.1
	X-Auth-Token: 5jPe+ONhwUY=

Response::

	HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
	Connection: close
	Content-Length: 37
	Content-Type: application/json

	{"value":"100,"mode":"enabled","code":1000}

Set brightness
--------------

Since firmware version: 2.3.5.

HTTP request
````````````

`POST /xled/v1/led/out/brightness`

Parameters
``````````

Parameters as JSON object.

`mode`:
	(string) one of "enabled", "disabled"
`type`:
	(string) always "A"
`value`:
	(integer) brightness level in range of 0..255

When `mode` is "disabled" no dimming is applied and the led works at full
brightness. It is not necessary to submit all the parameters, basically it
would work if only `value` or `mode` is supplied. `type` parameter can be
omitted, and the only value seen on the wire was "A". Brightness level value
seems to represent percent so 0 is dark and maximum meaningful value is 100.
Greater values doesn't seem to have any effect.

Response
````````

The response will be an object.

`code`
	(integer), application return code.

Example
```````

Set the brightness level to 10%:
